# Frontend Mentor - Browser extensions manager UI solution

This is my solution to the **Browser extensions manager UI** challenge on Frontend Mentor.  
The goal of this project was to practice building a realistic UI using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focusing on layout, interactivity, and theme switching.

## 🧩 Overview

Users should be able to:

- Remove extensions from the list
- Toggle between **light and dark mode**
- View a responsive layout on different screen sizes

## 🛠 My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- LocalStorage for theme persistence

---

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced:

- Structuring reusable UI components using semantic HTML
- Managing UI state with JavaScript (`data-*` attributes)
- Filtering content dynamically
- Implementing dark mode using CSS variables
- Using event delegation for better performance
- Saving user preferences with `localStorage`

This project helped me better understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM in a real-world UI.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- Add animations and transitions for better UX
- Refactor JavaScript into more reusable functions
- Start working with APIs and more complex state logic
